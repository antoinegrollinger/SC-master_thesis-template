# Template of Science master thesis for UCLouvain

## Compiling the report

To compile the report, use a Latex editor, e.g. Overleaf or Texmaker and put the "SC-master-thesis-covers-template-EN.tex" file as main.
Create a subfolder named "bst" with the .bst file in it and you are good to go.

## Updating the bib file

To update the bib file I would suggest you using the Zotero application which allows for a synchronized bibliography file with a browser extension.
